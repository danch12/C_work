Basic Idea for testing parsing section was to start with the commands that do not rely on the other commands eg VAR, OP etc. and then build the commands which use purely those and so on. Additionally I tried to first test each command by itself in its own struct before adding in other commands- so created a new struct to test POLISH, then a new struct for SET and so on. Was important to test the position that the functions move the struct to as well as this will be basis for how we move to next command.
