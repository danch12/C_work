For the extension part of the question I tried to create a faster way of searching using a best first algorithm. To determine best first I used a slightly modified version of the Gini Impurity coefficient that's used a lot in decision tree algorithms (https://bambielli.com/til/2017-10-29-gini-impurity/). But in this case instead of leafs I treated each shelf as its own leaf node and treated each colour as a separate class- then averaged them out across the shelves. Then when putting the bookcase into my linked list instead of inserting at the end of the linked list I ordered the linked list by their impurity level - so it was easy to go through and pick the most pure bookcases first.
